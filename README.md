# Simple Shell

Patricio Benglian and his, for the time being, protégé Patricio "Kindness" Coitiño have been sent into a mission by Holberton in which they have to create a simplified version of Shell. We have been working on this project for at least a week now, and It has been a lot of fun and truly eye opening.

## Authors:
 Patricio "Kindness" Coitiño and Patricio Benglian.
 
## Installation

## Usage:

```
You have to run [EXE] and you will receive a prompt: "$ ". 
Inside this prompt you will be free to run any command you wish to. 
For example: 

# This is the base prompt in which you will work!
$

# Runs 'ls'
$ ls

# Runs ls with the long format.
$ ls -l

# Removes said file.
$ rm sanity

# Creates a empty file with the given name.
$ touch restored_sanity
```
